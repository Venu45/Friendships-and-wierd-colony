There are N houses in a colony, numbered 0, 1, 2,...., N-1. Person in house A can deliver a letter to a person in house B if B is a friend of A. Friendship is not mutual in the colony i.e., it's not necessary that if A is a friend of B, B has to be a friend of A. Moreover, in this unique colony, friendship is not cyclic. Ramesh is an extremely intelligent boy in the colony but he has a phobia of big numbers. He developed curiosity to calculate the number of ways a letter can be delivered from a source to a destination. If the final number obtained is greater than or equal to , Ramesh takes Modulo  of the final answer and concludes the resulting number to be his answer.

Input Format

The First line contains an integer N, the number of houses in the colony.

The Second line contains two space separated integers, the source house number(S) and the destination house number(D) respectively.

The Third line contains an integer F, the number of friendships in the colony.

Each of the next F lines contains two space separated integers ui, vi meaning person in house vi is a friend of person in house ui i.e., person in house ui can deliver a letter to person in house vi but not vice versa.
